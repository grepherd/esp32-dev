# esp32-dev

This is a simple Docker container which contains the Xtensa ESP32 toolchain and esp-idf development framework.

Use `run.sh` to build and run the container. Your application code should be placed in the `volume` directory, which is passed to the container.

The included example code is from the [esp-idf repository](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). More interesting examples can also be found there.

Refer to [the official documentation](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linux-setup.html) for more information about the setup process.
